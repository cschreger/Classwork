                    consistently, run in different environments (client, server,
                     and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it 
                     provides a great developer experience, such as live code 
                     editing combined with a time traveling debugger.</li>

					<li>The whole state of your app is stored in an object 
                    tree inside a single store.The only way to change the state 
                    tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
                    To specify how the actions transform the state tree, 
                    you write pure reducers.</li>
